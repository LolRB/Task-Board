# Task-Board

## Description

This project is a task board designed to help project team members organize and manage multiple tasks effectively. The task board allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, while also providing a visual overview of the project's progress. Tasks are organized into columns representing their state of progress: "Not Yet Started," "In Progress," and "Completed." The board also features color-coded tasks to indicate urgency, helping users stay on track with deadlines.

## Features

- Task Display: All project tasks are displayed in columns based on their progress state.
- Color Coding: Tasks nearing their deadline are highlighted in yellow, and overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
- Task Creation: Users can define new tasks by entering a title, description, and deadline date via a modal dialog.
- Task Persistence: Tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring that they persist even after the page is refreshed.
- Drag and Drop: Users can update a task's progress state by dragging it to a different column.
- Task Deletion: Tasks can be removed from the board, with changes persisting after refresh.
